# The Many Faces of Dave

Let's face it, self-promotion has never been much of a concern for me. For about 15 years my website was merely a shame counter for how many days it had been since I told people I was launching a blog. Thanks to Heroku for dropping support for free hobby accounts, my so-called site fell over a few years ago and I never really bothered to pick it up.. until now.

I don't really have any grand plans for this other than to start out simple and gradually build up to a dynamic app or something. Maybe even start to invest more time in OSS contributions.

If you're reading this, you must have some interest in my career. Do me a solid and give me some feedback. Star the repo to signal support for developing this further. Or report an issue and tell me what you would specifically like to see.

## To Do List

- [x] Add Tailwind (output only for now)
- [x] Move hosting to Vercel or Fly.io
- [ ] Humble brag about dumb shit no one cares about
- [ ] Integrate my CV/work history
- [ ] Do something interesting with automation, branch protections, or integrated testing
